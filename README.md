## Tic-tac-toe Ai using Minimax

*Written in Python with a Gui*

To play select whether you want to go first or second on the main screen and then either lose or tie(since the ai plays perfectly using the minimax algorithm)

## Requirements :

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) which can be easily installed after installing python with the command -

```
pip3 install pygame
```
or in case that doesn't work
```
python3 -m pip3 install pygame
```

#### To run the program simply download all the files from the resporitory or clone them and then run runner.py using python

Note : the time.sleep() have been added in the program to improve the experience but you can remove or increase them to suit your interests
